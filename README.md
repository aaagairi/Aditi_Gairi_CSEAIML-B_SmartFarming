### üß∞ Technologies Used  
- Python  
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook  
- Scikit-learn (for ML models)  
- SVR (Support Vector Regression) for weather forecasting  
- Random Forest for crop yield prediction  
- Flask (for backend API)  
- HTML/CSS  
- Open-Meteo API (for weather data)  
- Government crop data (from [data.gov.in](https://data.gov.in))

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Steps to Run the Project

1. **Clone this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aaagairi/smart-farming-using-ai.git
   cd smart-farming-using-ai
   ```

2. **Install required Python libraries**  
   *(You can manually install from the notebook cells or create a `requirements.txt` using pip freeze)*  
   ```bash
   pip install flask scikit-learn pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
   ```

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebooks to train and test the models**  
   - Open and run `Crop_Yield_Prediction.ipynb`  
   - Open and run `Weather_Forecast_Model.ipynb`  
   These notebooks contain model training and evaluation logic.

4. **Start the Flask server**  
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```  
   This will launch your backend locally (usually at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`).

5. **Access the HTML pages via browser**  
   - `index.html`: Landing page  
   - `weather.html`: Weather forecasting interface  
   - `crop_yield.html`: Crop yield prediction interface  
   - `dashboard.html`: Summary dashboard (optional)

6. **Test the backend APIs**  
   You can use a browser or tools like **Postman** to test Flask routes. Make sure the server is running.

7. **(Optional) Modify or deploy**  
   - You can deploy this Flask app to platforms like **Render**, **Replit**, or **Heroku** for public access.
