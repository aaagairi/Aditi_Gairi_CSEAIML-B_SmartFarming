🧰 Technologies Used:
Python

Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

Scikit-learn (for ML models)

SVR (Support Vector Regression) – Weather Forecasting

Random Forest – Crop Yield Prediction

Flask (Backend API)

HTML/CSS (Optional Frontend)

Open-Meteo API (Weather Data Source)

Government Crop Data (from data.gov.in)

▶️ Steps to Run the Project:
Clone the repository or download the source code.

Set up a Python environment with the required libraries:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Open and run the Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook to train and test models.

Launch the Flask server to expose prediction APIs.

(Optional) Use Postman or connect a frontend to test API responses.

View predictions and evaluate model performance.
