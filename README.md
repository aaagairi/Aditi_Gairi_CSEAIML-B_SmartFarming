üß∞ Technologies Used:

Python
Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook
Scikit-learn (for ML models)
SVR (Support Vector Regression) for weather forecasting
Random Forest for crop yield prediction
Flask (for backend API)
HTML/CSS
Open-Meteo API (for weather data)
Government crop data (from data.gov.in)

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Steps to Run the Project:

Clone the repository or download the source code.
Set up a Python environment with required libraries (pip install -r requirements.txt).
Run the Google Colab notebook to train and test models.
Start the Flask server to expose the prediction APIs.
Connect the backend to a simple frontend or API testing tool like Postman.
View prediction outputs and evaluate performance.
